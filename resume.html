            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <h3>Survey Interviewer</h3>
            <p><strong>July 2023 - September 2023</strong><br>
            I worked as a Survey Interviewer for Elemental Data Collection, a marketing research firm, in Ottawa, ON, Canada. I worked on multiple projects that consisted of calling strangers and trying to convince them to answer survey questions, either for the government of Canada or private companies. Learned effective refusal conversions that could potentially change a caller’s opinion on the given survey. Also learned to adapt the approach depending on the caller, which was necessary as we called all throughout Canada. So the approach in calling someone from Newfoundland and Labrador was different from calling a French-Canadian in Quebec. The same applies to age demographics; for example, more explaining and a slower speech were more effective in conversations with seniors.</p>
